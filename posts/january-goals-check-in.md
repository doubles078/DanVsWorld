Overall a very successful first month.  January can be incredibly tricky.  The motivation is always very high to start the year, but the focus and organizination can waiver especially as I determine what really are the most important goals and habits.  But 30/30 days of drawing, guitar AND practicing Chinese is a huge win ðŸ¥³, as well as my reading actually being a bit ahead of schedule!


### Daily morning routine
I nailed all 3 of my morning routine goals... I just did not really do them as a morning routine.  Rather, I accomplished them randomly throughout the day depending on the day.

\
Chinese has been going well.  I reset my progress in the app I use [Hello Chinese](http://www.hellochinese.cc/) since I began a few years back.  They updated their lesson plans and added some extra words and grammar that has been very helpful.
\
\
The drawing course I am following - [DrawABox](https://drawabox.com) - I have found to be very difficult in places (form intersections).  So I find myself practicing drawing off of quick character or figure tutorials in my sketchbook.  I hope to really train my mind to focus time on some of the harder elements of drawing and be mindful of when I resist or stray.

Guitar has been going well.  Slowly making my way through [Justin Guitars](https://www.justinguitar.com/) blues lessons.  Similarly to drawing, I think I can focus more on making progress a bit quicker through the guitar lessons and focusing on some of the more difficult elements to grasp.

### Brazilian jiu-jitsu 3x a week
COVID, cold, snow and all of the excuses.  I really need to get in more, might even need to up my time to 4x a week to force myself into a habit if 3 does not do it.  February will be a big turn around month for this goal.

### Read 20 books within the year
Crushing through the Witcher series, so good.  A mixture of reading and Libby audiobooks.  I have been reading randomly throughout the day, and think it would be worth making it a bit more of a nightly habit.  Maybe cut back on Call of Duty a bit.

### Launch 2 tech projects within the year
Surprisingly, I actually spent a good couple of days playing with Slack bots and the Google Sheets api. I overcame some major hurdles regarding authentication with Google Sheets thanks to [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiPpQzW_ya0), after many many other tutorials and docs were sifted through.

### What to focus on for next month
1. Make my morning routine a *morning routine*
2. Go to BJJ no matter what (cold/rain/snow)
3. Make reading a nightly habit
4. Track coding days to spend adequate time on side projects
5. Focus on progress with guitar and drawing courses
