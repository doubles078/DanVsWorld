Quick update for this month.  Everything is going smoothly, daily habits have become a routine by now.  I have not missed a day of drawing (something), playing my guitar or practicing Chinese.

### Retrospective
Moving into March, I need to practice being more mindful with my goals.  Spend focused time and longer times on the ones I really care about, and push through the difficult parts. 

1. Finish my daily routines in the morning instead of playing video games
2. New daily habit: hip stretches daily
3. New daily habit: study BJJ and take notes
4. Be more mindful while practicing
